### Description of Idea

- IDea : To make a library managment system where student/library administrative can login.Admin can add,search,issue books,add users,delete users.
- student can see books issued to them,request,return books,see due date of books.
- Problem : In any institution of learning, library management has become a problem due to the continued use of the manually supported system. The current system makes it hard to serve students effectively. This is seen when students queue for not less than 10 minutes to borrow a book from a librarian who has got to register each student and the book borrowed manually hence wasting a lot of time. It is this perceived inefficiency and its associated high cost of labor in hiring several library assistants that rendered this Library Management System important.
